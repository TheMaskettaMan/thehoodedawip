this is the templlating tester.


variables surrounded by $[] should be interpolated into the appropriate text

first, we need to check if the correct variable names are slurped

I want to run things character by character for efficiency that regexes
are apparently incapable of

so, here we are: $[masketta] $[man]  $[testfailed?}  how to handle?
