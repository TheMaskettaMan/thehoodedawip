if this container is being built for the very first time:
we've mounted a volume to our default workdir,
you may need to manually run npm install to populate the working dir
with the correct npm modules,
as well as any other package managers that save modules to the local directory

attach to the container to run js/css builds and run the main flask app:
masketta_code/masketta_man.py


useful commands:
build: self-explanatory
watch: watch files for changes
